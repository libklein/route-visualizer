# RV - A simple route visualizer

RV is a simple route visualizer that allows you to easily visualize routes.
The minimal input is list of routes, which each contain a list of coordinates.
The generated html can run without a server, allowing to generate visualizations with simple curl requests.
These urls could be the, e.g., the output of an optimization algorithm.

## Features

* Pass locations in the URL - opening the link will render the map
* Pass additional attributes (metadata, styles, etc.) via POST
* Render routes based on additional attributes

## Usage

```
https://rv.libklein.com/lat1,lng1|lat2,lng2|lat3,lng3;\[route_color\]/lat1,lng1|...|latn,lngn;\[route_color\]/
```

### Page slug structure

Routes are separated by `/`, coordinates of individual locations by `|`.
Routes can optionally be colored by appending `;color` to the route.
